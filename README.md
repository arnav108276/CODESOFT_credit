# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. Using a dataset of credit card transactions, the model preprocesses the data, handles class imbalance issues, and trains a classification algorithm to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) dataset from Kaggle. It contains a set of transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders, where the positive class (1) represents fraud and the negative class (0) represents genuine transactions.

## Features

The dataset includes the following features:

- **V1, V2, ..., V28**: 28 anonymized features, which are the result of a PCA transformation.
- **Time**: The number of seconds elapsed since the first transaction in the dataset.
- **Amount**: The transaction amount.
- **Class**: The target variable indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or genuine (0).

## Installation

Make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn imbalanced-learn
